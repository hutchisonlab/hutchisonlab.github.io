<img alt="toc image" src="{{ page.header.teaser }}" width="300 px">{: .align-right} Stable ground-state triplet π-conjugated copolymers have many interesting electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, the large number of potential monomer combinations makes it impractical to synthesize or even just use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate their triplet ground-state stability. Here, we present a genetic algorithm implementation that uses the semi-empirical GFN2-xTB to find ground-state triplet polymer candidates. We find more than 1400 polymer candidates with a triplet ground-state stability of up to 4 eV versus the singlet. Additionally, we explore the properties of the monomers of those candidates in order to understand the design rules which promote the formation of a stable ground-state triplet in π-conjugated polymers.
