    title: "Anneliese Schmidt"
    excerpt: "*Polymer Synthesis Pro (2017--)*<br>
    **Anneliese synthesizes polymers with the [Meyer Group](http://www.meyer-chemistry.com), designing conjugated, polarizable sequenced oligomers for high capacitance energy storage.** Anneliese received her B.S. in chemistry from the University of South Carolina Upstate, with industrial research at Milliken and Company, where she synthesized small molecules as additives to improve various polymers’ properties, e.g. toughness or permeability.  The goal of my current project is to understand how the sequence of polymer side chains affects the dielectric constant of the polymer."

    title: "Caroline Chun"
    excerpt: "*Peptide AFM Virtuoso (2020--)*<br>
    **Caroline is working to find oligopeptides and other self-assembled monolayers with piezo activity using piezo-force microscopy (PFM/AFM) and calculations.** Caroline grew up in Philadelphia, South Korea, and Virginia and received a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Virginia. Some of her interests include traveling, strolling around, and reading magical realism literature."

    title: "Omri Abarbanel"
    excerpt: "*Machine Learning Maestro (2020--)*<br>
    **Omri combines his interest in chemistry and coding to find ML methods for rapid screening of complex molecular properties.** Omri was born in Israel and moved to the United States in 2011. He received his B.S. in Chemistry from CUNY Hunter College in 2017, and did a research internship on second harmonic generation imaging of peptide self-assembly structures with Dr. Rein Ulijn at CUNY Advanced Science Research Center. After that, he moved to Pittsburgh in 2018 to start his graduate program in Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh."

    excerpt: "*Organic Solar Cell Explorer (2020--)*<br>
    **Brianna utilizes computational methods and data science to optimize organic solar cells.** Brianna grew up in New York and received her B.S. in Chemistry from SUNY Binghamton University, where she did research on metal alloy nanoparticles as catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Here at Pitt, she was lured away from nanoparticle research during the COVID-19 lockdown. During her free time she enjoys painting and drawing."

    title: "Keren Lee"
    excerpt: "*Photovoltaic Pioneer (2022--)*<br>
    Born and raised in Memphis, TN, Keren received her B.S. in Chemistry from Rhodes College where she conducted research on solvatochromic molybdenum dyes for potential use in dye-sensitized solar cells. In her free time, she enjoys knitting, tending to her houseplants, and foisting plant cuttings upon friends and random passerby."

    title: "Maya Hayden"
    excerpt: "*Piezoeletronic Potions Master (2022--)*<br>
    Maya grew up in Bucks County, PA and received her BS from Smith College with a chemistry major, and music minor. At Smith she worked with Dr. Kevin Shea on synthesizing Neurolenin D analogs for use in lymphalic filariasis . She was drawn away from natural product synthesis into organic electronics, and hasn't looked back since. In her free time she rock climbs, plays French horn in chamber ensembles, tends to her 90+ plants, and watches detective shows with her two geriatric cats."
